Established in 1940, Pezza has built a strong reputation as a small, family-run restaurant spanning multiple generations. Recognizing the growth potential, they decided in 2020 to expand their operations and open additional branches, aiming to share their exceptional family secret pizzas with a wider audience.

To successfully realize this vision, Pezza made digital transformation their top priority. They forged a partnership with a reputable South African Software Solutions Company to guide them through this digital transition. It became evident that the development of robust back-office systems and the implementation of an online pizza-ordering system were critical components of this partnership. As part of the agreement, certain family members committed themselves to assisting in the development and maintenance of these systems.
